								<h4>Lucky Wei</h4>
								<p>Hi! My name is Lucky, a senior currently studying Graphic Design at Binghamton University. I'm glad that I take this as my major because I 've never been happier than working on a design project. I enjoy the moment when I get inspirations and sketch them on my notebook. Hope you enjoy my web journal! </p>

						<h1>Project 1:  Riddle Me This</h1>
						<p>My first project was a class collabaration and our mission is to create an online book of typographic riddles. Each person was assigned with developing a riddle that covered popular movies titles. After several rounds of discussion, we chose 1-2 designs from each person and decided the book title as Riddle Me This. The typeface is Futura, and the color palate is composed of red, yellow, blue, green. </p>
						<p><img class="r-image" src="images/P1BOOK.png"></p>
                        <p>Here is the official design verison of the riddle book. To view the full book, please check this link: <a href="https://binghamton-university-design.github.io/class-web-journal-LuckyGarbo/riddle-book.html" target="_blank">Riddle Me This</a></p>

						<p>From my drafts for the riddle book, I ended up going with DR.NO and XMEN for the final version. I did all my works in Adobe Illustrator and then exported as PNG file.  
						</p>
						<P><img class="r-image" src="images/P1DRNXM.png"></P>
                        <P>Here are my design version for the riddle book cover. Since it is a book about movie riddle, so I decided to use a book shape as the main body of the cover page. Then I added two beams of light from the left and right to make them look like a movie projector. In addition, those small dots I illustrated represent the spot of light which set off the party atmosphere for the whole image.</P>

						<h1>Project 2:  Working with the Past</h1>
						<p><img class="r-image" src="images/BUNNYSKETCH.png"></p>
						<p>For this project, my work is to create a pixel icon. After doing some researches, I decided to design a pixel bunny for my bunny toy, who named Wiley. Also, I'm a bunny lover and I love to collect bunny toys. </p>
						<p>The first step is to sketch a bitmap icon on graph paper. After a few revisions, the final version of the icon has been decided. Then I moved on to the digital icon. I used Photoshop to create my pixel bunny and I also designed both black/white and colored versions. Hope you like it!

						<h1>Project 2:  Working with the Past</h1>
						<p>Here is the process and color pallete when I worked on the bitmap icon. From left to right, I started with basic black and white, then I tried to add simple colors. Next, I decided to give a background until the last one I added some decorations on the backgroud. The working process is interesting and enjoyable, I will keep updating more pixel icons later and you can check them under the <i>Project For Fun</i>. </p>

						<h1>Project 3:  Digital Storytelling</h1>
						<p>For this project, my job is to create a world and tell a story by designing an online narrative. Speak of an immersive interactive story,
                       it can be many things like cooking recipe, or a fairytale..</p>
						
						<p>All things are difficult before they are easy. It took me a long tome
                           on choosing my story. Finally, I decide to make a website to let people 
                           learn more about me, like telling a self-story. My idea is to design 4 scenes. 
                           The first two will be in my house with the objects that best represent 
                           myself. Another scene I am thinking is to illustrate a Miniature Landscape 
                           of Seattle, a city I lived for 4 years. The best choice would be the Starbucks 
                           Reserve Roastery in Capitol Hill because I have so many memories of it. 
                           The last one is the subway station in my hometown and it will be the story 
                           of how I met my boyfriend.</p>
